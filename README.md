# Overview

The Car Management System is a basic web application that demonstrates the interaction between a React frontend and an Express backend. The frontend displays a list of sample cars retrieved from the backend and allows users to add new cars. The backend provides endpoints for fetching, adding, and deleting car data.


# Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Car Management System:

Clone this repository or download the source code.
Navigate to the project directory using your terminal or command prompt.
Install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend 

# Usage

To run the Car Management System, follow these steps:

Start the Express backend:
The backend will start and listen on http://localhost:3000.

Then Start the React frontend:
The frontend will start and open in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.
You can now interact with the Car Management System. The frontend will display a list of sample cars, and you can add new cars by filling out the form. You can also delete all car data using the "Delete All Cars" button.

# Backend API

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

GET /api/v1/cars: Retrieve a list of cars.
POST /api/v1/cars: Add a new car.
DELETE /api/v1/cars: Delete all car data.
You can access these endpoints through the frontend or by using tools like curl or Postman.

# Folder Structure

The project structure is divided into two main folders:

frontend: Contains the React frontend code.
backend: Contains the Express backend code.
